# Lambda Notes

1. interface with just one method also called as functional interface
2. interface myinterface{ p.v.greet()}
3. we cannot create object of interface
4. so we can't use method directly, we use lambda expression
5. -> called as arrow token is used
6. `MyInterfaceName method_1 (x,y,z)->{.....defintion of function.....};` function can have parameters x,y,z
7. Java 8 has different readymade functional interfaces built in
8. e.g. predicate interface from java.util with test method
9.
